/* NOTES:
/* 	Test of Assumptions: We will validate the "iid" assumption of linear regression by examining the residuals of our final
/*   	model. Specifically, we will use diagnostic statistics from REG as well as create an output dataset of
/*		residual values for PROC UNIVARIATE to test.
/*
/* 	Testing for Multicollinearity vif
/*	Multicollinearity is when your independent,X, variables are correlated. A statistic called the
/*	Variance Inflation Factor, VIF, can be used to test for multicollinearity. A cut off of 10 can be used to
/*	test if a regression function is unstable. If VIF>10 then you should search for causes of multicollinearity
/*
/* Testing for Outliers: INFLUENCE R
/*		A Cook's D greater than the absolute value of 2 should be investigated.
/*		RSTUDENT is the studentized deleted residual.The studentized deleted residual checks if the model is significantly different 
/*			if an observation is removed. An RSTUDENT whose absolute value is larger than 2 should be investigated. 
/*		DFFITS:	Observations whose DFFITS values are extreme in relation to the others should be investigated. An abbreviated
/*			version of the printout is listed.
/*		Dfbetas statistics can be used to find outliers that influence an particular parameter's coefficient. 
/*			For small to medium sized  datasets, a Dfbetas over 1.0 should be investigated.
/*
/*		Testing the Fit of the Model: 
/*			The overall fit of the model can be checked by looking at the F-Value and its corresponding p-value (Prob >F) 
/*			for the total model under the Analysis of Variance portion of the REG or GLM print out.
/*			Generally, you want a Prob>F value less than 0.05

R-square and Adj-Rsq: You want these numbers to be as high as possible. If your model has a lot of variables,
	use Adj-Rsq because a model with more variables will have a higher R-square than a similar model with fewer variables. Adj-Rsq
	takes the number of variables in your model into account. An R-square or 0.7 or higher is generally accepted as good.

Root MSE: You want this number to be small compared to other models. The value of Root MSE will be dependent on the values of the Y variable you
	are modeling. Thus, you can only compare Root MSE against other models that are modeling the same dependent variable.

Type III SS Pr>F: As a guideline, you want the value for each of the variables in your model to have a Type III SS p-value of 0.05 or less. 
	This is a judgement call. If you have a p-value greater than .05 and are willing to accept a lesser confidence level, then you can use the model. 
 	Do not substitute Type I or Type II SS for Type III SS. They are different statistics and could lead to incorrect conclusions in some cases

Other approaches to finding good models are having a small PRESS statistic (found in REG as Predicted Resid SS (Press)) or having a CP statistic
of p-1 where p is the number of parameters in your model. CP can also be found using PROC REG. 

When building a model only eliminate one term,variable or interaction, at a time. From examining the GLM printout, we will drop the interaction term
of BEDROOMS*SQFEET as the Type III SS indicates it is not significant to the model. If an interaction term is significant to a model, its
individual components are generally left in the model as well. It is also generally accepted to leave an intercept in your model unless you have a good
reason for eliminating it. We will use BEDROOMS,S1, S2 and S3 in our final model.


Some of the approaches for choosing the best model listed above are available in SELECTION= options of REG and SELECTION= options of GLM.
 For example:
 	PROC REG;
 	MODEL PRICE = BEDROOMS SQFEET
 	S1 S2 S3 / SELECTION = ADJRSQ;

	will iteratively run models until the model with the highest adjusted R-square is found. Consult the SAS/STAT User's Guide for details.
